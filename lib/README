Additional args: --no-sound-null-safety

Total number of Unit testcases : 7
State Management architecture used : Bloc

Features Added :

1. Dashboard can be used to view products in List or Grid format.
2. In Product Details we can add to cart after selecting quantity which we need. Max Quantity set to 10.
3. In Cart the Items added are cached so when we close the app the cart is intact. Actual approach is to use backend for storing the cart
   data but for simplicity used the local backend.
4. The Cart Items are clickable so we can view the product details from the cart page.
5. Search Bar has been implemented in the dashboard which allows user to search the product based on title.
